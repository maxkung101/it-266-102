IT-266 Quake II
===============
This is the repository where I make Quake II edits for NJIT's course IT 266.

About Quake II
==============
Quake II is a first person shooter game developed by id software. Gameplay includes single player mode, and multiplayer mode.

Edits
=====
The blaster, hyperblaster, and rocket launcher now shoot three bullets/missles at once. I have also made the blaster shoot faster.

The grenades are now timer bombs. When thrown or launched, another player has to step on it so it can explode.

A new weapon has been created. It is the deathray, in which it is almost a clone of the raygun, except that it uses slugs.

New tools have been created: the grappling hook and the jetpack
