Edits
=====
The default blaster, hyperblaster, and rocket launcher now shoot three bullets/missles at once.

The grenades are now timer bombs. When thrown or launched, another player has to step on it so it can explode.

A new weapon has been created. It is the deathray, in which it is almost a clone of the raygun, except that it uses slugs.

A new tool has been created. It is the grappling hook.
