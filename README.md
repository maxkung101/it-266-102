Edits
=====
The blaster, hyperblaster, and rocket launcher now shoot three blasts/rockets at once. I have also made the blaster shoot faster.

The grenades are now smart bombs. When thrown or launched, another player has to step on it so it can explode.

A new weapon has been created. It is the deathray, in which it is almost a clone of the raygun, except that it uses slugs.

New tools have been created: the grappling hook and the jetpack

Play dead command has been added. To activate, press " ` " (located below "ESC" and left of "1") and then type " bind q "playdead" ".

Throw up command has been added. To activate, press " ` " (located below "ESC" and left of "1") and then type " bind h "give throwup" ".
